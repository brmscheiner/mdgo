Find commands in markdown files and execute them. A handy tool for those who are tired of copy-paste chaos!

## Installation

```bash
npm install --global mdgo
```

## Usage

Point `mdgo` to a markdown file to parse that file for commands. Use `<Tab>`, number or arrow keys to pick the command you want to run and hit `<Enter>`
