Tired of opening the same file again and again just to copy and paste a command? There's a better way. MDGO parses Markdown files for commands. Execute them without ever leaving the CLI.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --global mdgo
```

## Usage

Point `mdgo` to a markdown file to parse that file for commands. Use arrow keys, tab, or numbers to select the command you want and hit Enter to run it

### Options
```
--boxy, -b add cute lil boxes around the commands
```
